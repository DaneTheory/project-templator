# Composability

This project is designed for easy composition of a templating (or file transformation) solution that suits your needs.

It can be used with a number of other libraries,  such as:

- [action-file-gen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/action-file-gen) generates files based on actions, inspired by [plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop)
- [simple-vfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-vfs) a simple virtual File System
- [multi-prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multi-prompt) ask propts in multiple sections
- [package-retriever](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/package-retriever) retrieve packages either from a git repo or npm. Optionally cache locally. (note: extracted from [sao](https://github.com/saojs/sao))
- [object-templator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-templator) smart templating of nested data structures, for `JSON`, `YAML` and `js`
